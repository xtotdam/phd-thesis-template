  abstract = {Bit patterned media (BPM) provide an alternative to conventional granular thin film recording media, circumventing the challenges of managing grain size and its associated noise and thermal stability issues in granular media. A viable fabrication strategy involves creation of a master pattern by rotary-stage e-beam lithography and directed self-assembly of block copolymers, followed by pattern replication via UV-cure nanoimprint lithography and pattern transfer to a magnetic thin film by ion beam etching. These steps have been demonstrated for 150 Gdot/cm2 (1 Tdot/in2) hcp patterns, achieving a dot placement tolerance of 1.2 nm 1$\sigma$ and a defect rate of <; 10-3. Media samples fabricated in this manner from continuous CoCrPt alloy films have achieved a 1$\sigma$ switching field distribution of 4% of Hc. A 2T medium SNR of nearly 14 dB and a write bit error rate of 2 $\times$ 10-3 have been shown using a static tester with a conventional product read/write head. Modeling and experiment suggest that higher recording density can be achieved using BPM with a bit aspect ratio (BAR) >; 1. A master pattern generation generation strategy for BAR>; 1 with rectangular islands is shown using intersecting lines generated by directed self-assembly of lamellar block copolymers in combination with spacer-defined line doubling.},

At small current densities the layers are oriented except in the case of zinc and cadmium. The nickel and cobalt deposits give patterns containing additional spots, lines and irrational spots. It is shown that these are accounted for by assuming the occurrence of repeated twinning on (111) planes, the additional spots being due to twinned lattices and the lines due to twin planes. The twin planes must be considered separately and not simply as part of the lattices on either side of them. The thin sheets of lattice thus formed give rise to the irrational spots observed. Finally, a discussion is given of the factors determining the orientation of a layer of metal on the copper crystal.},

The final structure of the epitaxial film is decided in the very early stage of submonolayer nucleation and island growth. Recent experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy opened up an unprecedented view of this early stage of epitaxial growth. Variable sample temperatures enabled quantification of the rates of the most important atomic diffusion events and tracing back their interplay yielding the final submonolayer morphology. The present understanding of nucleation and aggregation in light of these new experimental results is reviewed for the case of metals. Examples are given how the growth kinetics can be employed to create well-defined island morphologies and island arrays in a self-organization process.},

  abstract = { The fastest long-period random number generators currently available are based on linear recurrences modulo 2. So far, software that provides multiple disjoint streams and substreams has not been available for these generators because of the lack of efficient jump-ahead facilities. In principle, it suffices to multiply the state (a k-bit vector) by an appropriate k × k binary matrix to find the new state far ahead in the sequence. However, when k is large (e.g., for a generator such as the popular Mersenne twister, for which k = 19,937), this matrix-vector multiplication is slow, and a large amount of memory is required to store the k × k matrix. In this paper, we provide a faster algorithm to jump ahead by a large number of steps in a linear recurrence modulo 2. The method uses much less than the k2 bits of memory required by the matrix method. It is based on polynomial calculus modulo the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence, and uses a sliding window algorithm for the multiplication. },

The holes are produced by a spontaneous surface etching process related to the formation of a surface alloy which, in turn, produces an enhancement of the surface diffusion. As a result of these phenomena there is a noticeable and unexpected mass transport at the surface during growth. We illustrate how these processes have an impact on the growth mode of Co on Cu(111).},

The atomic processes responsible for the formation of the simplest types of nanostructures are identified. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the Cu(100) surface with the embedded Co atoms can be divided into three stages. The surface morphology is observed during these three stages at substrate temperatures of 300–400 K and low concentrations of Co atoms. The magnetic properties of the structures forming in the first two stages are calculated using density functional theory. The spin and orbital magnetic moments and the magnetic anisotropy energy of these embedded nanostructures are obtained. In this way, the time evolution of the structural and magnetic properties of a Cu(100) surface with embedded Co atoms is investigated. },

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

  abstract = {There are numerous emerging nonvolatile memory technologies, which have been proposed as being capable of replacing hard disk drives (HDDs). In this paper, the prospects for these alternative technologies to displace HDDs in 2020 are analyzed. In order to compare technologies, projections were made of storage density and performance in year 2020 for both hard disks and the alternative technologies, assuming the alternative technologies could solve their remaining problems and assuming that hard drives would continue to advance areal density at a pace of about 40% per year, which would result in a two-disk 2.5-in disk drive that stores approximately 40 Terabytes and costs about $40. A major conclusion of the study is that to compete with hard drives on a cost per terabyte basis will be challenging for any solid state technology, because the ITRS lithography roadmap limits the density that most alternative technologies can achieve. Those technologies with the best opportunity have a small cell size and the capability of storing multiple bits per cell. Phase change random access memory (PCRAM) and spin transfer torque random access memory (STTRAM) appear to meet these criteria. PCRAMs are being marketed by at least one supplier and therefore appear to be closer to practical realization. On the other hand, STTRAMs would appear to have a performance edge assuming they, too, can be brought to market with multiple bits per cell. Although there are technologies that are not limited by the lithography roadmap and thus have greater areal density potential, they tend to be further from practical realization.},

  abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron—electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron—electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree—Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

Spatially resolved conductance measurements along a 20-atom chain provide the dispersion relation, effective mass, and density of states of the free electron{\textendash}like band. These experiments demonstrate a strategy for probing the interrelation between geometric structure, elemental composition, and electronic properties in metallic nanostructures.},

  abstract = {The growth of cobalt on Cu(111) has been studied using a variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM). At a deposition temperature of 150 K, one observes the growth of three-layer Co islands with one subsurface layer. The Co islands are surrounded by a brim of Cu. The distinction between Co and Cu is made by adsorption of \{CO\} which adsorbs only on Co at room temperature, resulting in a Co(111)-($\sqrt{}$3 $\times$ $\sqrt{}$3)R30$\deg$-CO structure. After heating the surface, or depositing Co at higher temperatures, the Cu brims gradually disappear, and vacancy islands form in the Cu(111) surface. The top-layer CoCu composition changes slowly at room temperature with Co being replaced by Cu on a timescale of $\sim$ 1 h, consistent with earlier ion-scattering studies. The experimental findings are in accordance with ab-initio total-energy calculations showing the thermodynamically stable island configuration to be several cobalt layers capped with one copper layer.},

  abstract = {During growth of submonolayer films of Co on Cu(111) at 280&#xa0;K, the surface is damaged by etching, leading to an increase in the interfacial mixing and roughness. By means of a quantitative \{STM\} study, we analyze the influence of the temperature of the substrate on this etching. Our results for 1/8&#xa0;ML of Co indicate that the etching rate is considerably reduced by lowering the substrate temperature to 140&#xa0;K during Co deposition only. The total etched area observed after annealing the film to 300&#xa0;K can be reduced by a factor of five, although the etching process continues at a much lower rate. From the quantification of both the etched area and the Cu content within terrace islands, we argue that the etching is basically due to the diffusion of Cu atoms out of the step-edges. Such a diffusion process, which is significantly diminished at low temperature, takes place at the early stages of the growth, i.e. during Co aggregation and island formation. },

Fourier transforms of the images showed a ring of radius 2kF, where kF is the Fermi wave vector of the Be(0001) surface state. This wavelength was expected from Friedel oscillations caused by electronic screening of surface defects, but the amplitude of the waves for energies near the Fermi energy was anomalously large and inconsistent with the Friedel concept of screening. The enhanced amplitude of the waves must be a many-body effect, either in the electron gas (possibly an incipient charge density wave) or in the response of the lattice (electron-phonon coupling).},

  abstract = {Surface-state-mediated interactions influence the spatial distribution of adatoms at surfaces. These indirect interactions are the driving force for the creation of superlattices of individual adsorbed atoms when the adatom concentration, the sample temperature, and the adatom diffusion barrier are in a subtle balance, as it has been first reported for Ce adatoms on Ag(1 1 1). The conditions for the formation of such superlattices are discussed. Specifically, the adatom concentration is shown to modify considerably the electronic structure of the Ag(1 1 1) surface. With increasing temperature the superlattice undergoes a direct transition from a two-dimensional solid to a two-dimensional liquid. Such superlattices, consisting of magnetic adatoms, may be interesting as model systems for the study of direct and indirect magnetic interactions in two dimensions. },
